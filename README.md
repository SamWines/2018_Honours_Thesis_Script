# 2018_Honours_Thesis_Script
This repository contains all scripts created for analysis used in my honours thesis.

To aid in reproducibility of this work, all processing analysis of raw outputs from EventMeasure and ArcGIS, through to creation of final predictive maps have been completed in the open-source programming language, R. 

All data supporting these results are stored in online repositories. Baited Remote Underwater Video annotations and metadata are stored in an online repository named GlobalArchive (http://globalarchive.org). High-resolution multibeam echosounder and LiDAR grids are stored in Deakin Universityâ€™s Victorian Marine Data Portal, supported by the Australian Ocean Data Network through the Integrated Marine Observing System and Australian National Data Service. This data is available at https://vmdp.deakin.edu.au/.

Titles of each script outline it's objective. Numbering of scripts dentotes their positioning in the overall process of this project, and should thereby be run subsequently.
